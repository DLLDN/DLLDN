Project Objective
For this data analysis project, I have conducted SQL queries to show statistical information of countries and regions who potentially have a high-risk to Anti-Money Laundering procedures, using the Index of Economic Freedom 2023 as my dataset.

Index of Economic 2023
The Index of Economic Freedom is an annual ranking of countries based on their degree of economic freedom. It is published annually by the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal.
