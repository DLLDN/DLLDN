# Project Objective
For this data analysis project, I have conducted SQL subqueries to analyse countries and regions who are potentially high-risk in regards to Anti-Money Laundering procedures, using the Index of Economic Freedom 2023 as my dataset. 

# Index of Economic Freedom
The Index of Economic Freedom is an annual ranking of countries based on their degree of economic freedom. It is published annually by the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal.

# Anti-Money Laundering
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) encompasses laws, regulations, and procedures aimed at preventing the disguise of illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. Its primary objectives are to detect, report, and prevent money laundering activities that conceal the illicit origin, nature, or ownership of funds. Of the 12 indicators in the Economic Freedom Index, 4 strongly relate to AML – Judicial Effectiveness, Government Integrity, Financial Freedom, and Property Rights.

# The Four Indicators
Judicial effectiveness gauges the efficiency and fairness of a legal system in enforcing laws, including those related to anti-money laundering. A strong, independent judiciary is crucial for combating money laundering through fair trials, upholding AML laws, and facilitating asset seizures, thereby effectively prosecuting financial crimes and enforcing AML regulations.

Government integrity assesses corruption levels and transparency in governance, with higher integrity supporting anti-money laundering efforts by reducing official corruption and promoting effective AML regulation enforcement. This factor is essential for creating an environment that discourages money laundering and enhances the effectiveness of AML measures by building trust in government institutions to combat financial crimes.

Financial freedom evaluates banking efficiency and independence from government control, supporting AML efforts by promoting transparency and enabling robust compliance programs in the financial sector. This factor facilitates international cooperation in tracking illicit 
funds, contributing to a more effective and responsive financial system in combating money laundering.

Property rights measure the strength of a country's legal protection for private ownership, supporting AML efforts by making it harder to conceal illicit assets and enabling authorities to trace and seize criminal proceeds. This factor fosters a legal environment that is less conducive to money laundering activities and more supportive of effective AML measures by promoting financial transparency.
